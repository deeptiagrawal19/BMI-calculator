# BMI-calculator
The BMI Calculator is a Python application using tkinter for a simple GUI. It allows users to compute their Body Mass Index (BMI) using either American or Metric units. Users enter their height and weight, and the app calculates and displays the BMI along with a weight status category (underweight, healthy, overweight, or obese).
